# quant-learning-tracker

Overview
--------
This repository will store my notebooks and data while I begin learning Quantitative Finance. I will be self teaching myself via online videos, textbooks and whatever else I may find along the way.

### Core goals
- Build strong probability / statistics intuition (Steve Brunton's Probability Bootcamp).
- Master practical option pricing (Black–Scholes, Greeks, delta-hedging).
- Learn Monte Carlo, SDE discretization, and variance reduction.
- Implement robust EDA / time-series analysis (ACF/PACF, stationarity, realized volatility).
- Build reliable backtests and portfolio construction tools (Ledoit–Wolf, factor models).
- Apply ML carefully to time-series problems (walk-forward CV, no-leakage).
- Prepare for interviews (algorithm practice + system design basics).
- Deliver reproducible notebooks, unit tests, CI, and a small deployable pricing endpoint.
