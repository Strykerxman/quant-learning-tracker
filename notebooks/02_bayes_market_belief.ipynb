    "- We obtain evidence that updates our beliefs on a hypothesis.\n",
    "- Think of the area of probabilities instead of counting directly (10x10 square)\n",
    "- Use 'x out of 100' for better intuition -> area\n",
    "- Probability is proportions\n",
    "- Look at cases where evidence is true and consider proportion of those cases where hypothesis is also true\n",
    "- Use of the term 'likelihood', combined with a 'prior' gives the probability. \n",
